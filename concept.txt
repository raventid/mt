Modern world require software systems and programming language to meet the needs of industry, modern computing and requirements. Ruby is popular scriting programming language and widely used for web-application, shell scripts, glue software, automatization, scintific researches and many more. With Python, Php, Javascript, Perl it forms group of modern dynamic languages, wich are faced with a concurency and parallelism challenges. At this paper we'll see how these languages are solving this kind of problems and what could be taken from other language families to improve user experience for creating highly concurrent and parallel applications. We'll take a look at how different language approach concurrency problem Scala, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Concurrent ML, Racket, Go, Haskell. And try to find what approach is more suited for dynamic languages family.
